The scripts in 'data-scripts' generate the csv files from the raw data.

'master-script.sh' inside 'data-scripts' takes 4 parameters:
  1. the cpu raw result  
  2. the gpu raw result. 
  3. 0 or 1 (0 is for minimum values and 1 is for median values across all runs)
  4. the path to where to save the generated csv; 
     the path should have the same directory structure as the 'data-generated' folder.

The scripts in 'plotting-scripts' use the generated csvs. They assume the same directory structure as the one in 'data-generated'.
